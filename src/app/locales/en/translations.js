            The world has gone to hell... Again. This time, it wasn't the zombies, but nuclear war
            that has decimated most of the population, leaving entire cities and areas uninhabitable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Put yourself in the shoes of one of the survivors, with their tragic story, and journey through
            the desert, the beach, the mountains and the city, toxic like your ex, to discover a
            new way of life while fighting to see a new day.

        <h2>WANTED: BETA TESTERS</h2>
        <p>
            If you're not familiar with this free narrative deckbuilding game for mobile, you can find the description on the home page.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you already know it, <b>I need your help</b>. Google has changed its policies for indie developers like me.
            Now, <b>testers are needed</b> to ensure smooth operation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game will be free for the community (No microtransactions or anything like that), so if you help me, you'll assist a small developer in fulfilling their dream of publishing a game just to make their mark on the world.
        </p>
        <h2>IF YOU HELP TEST</h2>
        <p>
            The testing will take place over two weeks, during which you'll need to play and report any bugs you encounter.
            The game has already been tested throughout its year of development, so you shouldn't encounter major issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Google emphasizes that it's important to note these are 14 days of testing. But don't panic, it won't be a job,
            just a little playtime each day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the process is complete, everyone who has helped will be credited in the Credits section and deep within
            my geeky heart.
